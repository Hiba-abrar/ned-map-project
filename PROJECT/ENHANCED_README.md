## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct Build (Recommended)
```cmd
build_enhanced.bat
```

### Option 2: CMake Build
```cmd
mkdir enhanced_build
cd enhanced_build
cmake -f ../enhanced_CMakeLists.txt ..
cmake --build .
enhanced_navigator.exe
```

### Option 3: Standalone HTML (No Server)
Simply open `enhanced_navigator.html` in your browser for client-side only features.

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup
1. **Start the application** - Voice says: "Welcome to NED Campus Navigator!"
2. **GPS Prompt** - "Would you like to allow GPS access for your location?"
   - Say **"Yes"** or click **"✅ Yes, Allow GPS"** for automatic location
   - Say **"No"** or click **"❌ No, Manual Input"** for alternatives

### 2. Location Options
If GPS is denied or unavailable:
- **📝 Manual Coordinates**: Enter exact lat/lon coordinates
- **🏢 Select Department**: Choose from campus location list

### 3. Navigation
1. **Set Destination**: Type or speak your destination
2. **Route Calculation**: System finds optimal path using advanced algorithms
3. **Voice Guidance**: First instruction is spoken automatically
4. **Step Control**: 
   - Say **"Next"** or click **"⏭️ Next"** for next instruction
   - Say **"Repeat"** or click **"🔄 Repeat"** to hear current step again
   - Say **"Previous"** or click **"⏮️ Previous"** to go back

### 4. Voice Commands
- **"Navigate from [location] to [location]"**
- **"Go to [destination]"**
- **"Next step"** / **"Continue"**
- **"Repeat"** / **"Say again"**
- **"Previous"** / **"Go back"**

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend (C++)
- **Enhanced Pathfinding**: Dijkstra's algorithm with realistic waypoints
- **Location Matching**: Fuzzy string matching for voice input
- **RESTful API**: JSON endpoints for frontend communication
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent request handling

### Frontend (HTML5/JavaScript)
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive mapping with routing
- **Web Speech API**: Voice recognition and synthesis
- **Geolocation API**: GPS coordinate access
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatible

### API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/locations          - Get all campus locations
POST /api/route             - Calculate route from GPS to destination
POST /api/find-location     - Find location by voice/text query
```

- **Microphone Access**: For voice commands
- **Internet Connection**: For map tiles (OpenStreetMap)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. GPS Not Working**
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost access
- Check browser location permissions
- Try manual coordinate input as fallback

**2. Voice Commands Not Recognized**
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly and wait for listening indicator
- Use alternative button controls

**3. Build Errors**
- Ensure MinGW-w64 or Visual Studio is installed
- Check C++17 compiler support
- Verify all header files are present

**4. Server Won't Start**
- Check if port 8080 is available
- Run as administrator if needed
- Try different port in source code

**5. Map Not Loading**
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenStreetMap access
- Try refreshing the page

### Performance Tips
- Use Chrome or Firefox for best performance
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser
- Close other applications for better GPS accuracy
- Use wired internet for faster map loading

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Locations
Edit `campus_locations` vector in `enhanced_main.cpp`:
```cpp
{"New Location", latitude, longitude, "type", "description", {"alias1", "alias2"}}
```

### Modifying Voice Commands
Update `processVoiceCommand()` function in the HTML file.

### Changing Map Style
Replace the tile layer URL in the JavaScript:
```javascript
L.tileLayer('https://your-tile-server/{z}/{x}/{y}.png')
```
